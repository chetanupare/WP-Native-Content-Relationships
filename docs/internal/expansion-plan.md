# 90-day expansion plan

Internal roadmap. The code is no longer the bottleneck; visibility and positioning are.

## Month 1

- Publish architecture doc
- Publish performance benchmark
- Clean namespace completely
- Announce 1.1 roadmap

## Month 2

- Release WPGraphQL add-on
- Publish 3 real-world tutorials
- Improve WP.org visuals (banner, screenshots)

## Month 3

- Reach out to theme authors
- Reach out to agency devs
- Submit guest article to WP blogs
- Encourage contributors

## Evaluation

The plugin is **technically strong enough** for ecosystem growth.

**Growth depends on:**

- Marketing discipline
- Documentation excellence
- Performance transparency
- Stability commitment

**If we do this properly**, it could become:

- A default modeling layer for complex WordPress builds
- A recommended tool in developer tutorials
- A long-term infrastructure dependency
