# Gutenberg

The plugin provides a **Related Content** block for the block editor.

## Block: Related Content

- **Block name:** `naticore/related-posts`
- **Attributes:** Relation type, limit, order, layout (list/grid), optional thumbnail and excerpt.

## Usage

1. In the block editor, add a block and search for “Related Content” or “Native Content Relationships”.
2. Insert the block and use the sidebar to choose the relationship type, number of items, and layout.
3. The block uses the current post as the source; you can expose a post ID option in block settings if the plugin supports it.

The block output is consistent with the [shortcodes](/getting-started/basic-relationships#shortcodes) and shares the same markup and styling hooks.
