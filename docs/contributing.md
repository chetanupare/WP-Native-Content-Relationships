# Contributing

Contributions to Native Content Relationships are welcome.

## How to contribute

1. **Reporting issues** — Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/chetanupare/WP-Native-Content-Relationships/issues) with steps to reproduce, WordPress/PHP versions, and expected vs actual behavior.
2. **Documentation** — Fix typos or improve clarity in this docs site or the plugin readme via pull request.
3. **Code** — Fork the repo, create a branch, make changes, run the project’s linter (`composer lint` if available), and open a PR with a clear description.

## Standards

- **PHP** — Follow WordPress coding standards; the project may use PHPCS with a custom ruleset.
- **Stability** — Avoid breaking the public API or database schema; new features should be backward compatible where possible.
- **Hooks** — Prefer existing [hooks and filters](/api/hooks-filters) over core edits when extending behavior.
