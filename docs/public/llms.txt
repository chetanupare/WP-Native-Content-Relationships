# Native Content Relationships

> Native Content Relationships (NCR) is a WordPress plugin that adds a first-class relationship layer: link posts, users, and taxonomy terms via a dedicated indexed table and a small PHP API. Use for related posts, favorites, parent-child, WooCommerce related products, and custom relation types. Schema and public API are stable from 1.x; backward compatibility is guaranteed.

Important notes:

- Object types: `post` (any post type), `user`, `term`. Relation types (e.g. `related_to`, `parent_of`) define from/to and optional max_connections.
- Primary API: `ncr_add_relation()`, `ncr_get_related()`, `ncr_remove_relation()`, `ncr_register_relation_type()`. Prefer these over legacy `wp_*` wrappers.
- WP_Query: use query var `content_relation` with `post_id`, `type`, `direction` to query posts by relationship.
- Hooks: `ncr_relation_added`, `ncr_relation_removed`, `ncr_get_related_args`, `ncr_max_relationships`, `ncr_skip_relationship_query`.
