# Welcome to the NCR Blog

We’re building **Native Content Relationships** because WordPress still doesn’t have a first-class way to link content. Post meta doesn’t scale. Taxonomies are for grouping, not for “post A is related to post B.” We wanted one table, one API, and the same relationships everywhere: PHP, REST, shortcodes, Gutenberg, Elementor.

This blog will cover use cases, migration stories, performance notes, and roadmap updates. No fluff.
